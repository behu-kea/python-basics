# Rock Paper Scissors



> Remember to use methods for this assignment

You have to create a rock, paper, scissors game. The game should have two modes:

1. Multiplayer - person vs person
2. Singleplayer - person vs computer



## Multiplayer

When playing in the multiplayer mode, the game should ask for the two players names 

Now the users will play 1 round of rock paper scissor

After the round a message should be printed that shows either who won or a message saying the game was a draw 



## Singleplayer

When playing in singleplayer mode the user is playing against a computer. The user puts in his name and they now play one round. 

After the rounds a message should be printed that shows either who won or a message saying the game was a draw. 



## Advanced level



### 3 rounds

A game consists of 3 rounds



### Player decides number of rounds

Let the player decide the number of rounds



## Expert level



### Player decides number of rounds

Make it so that two players (person vs person and person vs computer) has to find a winner in each round. No draws, they keep playing until someone has lost!



### Intelligent computer

Instead of just randomnly choosing sign (rock, paper or scissors). Look at the history of the other player and make a better informed selection. You could fx check

- Which sign does the oponent use the most?
- Which signs does the user play after he has played another sign. Fx he often plays rock after he has played scissor
- Which signs does the user play after the opponent played another sign. Fx he often plays rock after the oponent played scissor
- Maybe a combination
- Try do some research on the topic:

### Drawing what you picked with ascii art!

Make the game a bit more visual (in the terminal), fx print a hand with ascii art when a hand has been selected.
