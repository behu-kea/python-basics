# Crypto converter 🚀🌕💎🙌



We are joining the crypto train, choo choo everybody aboard 🚂☁️☁️☁️☁️

Let's make a python program that works like this👇

A user specifies how many dollars he wants to convert into crypto currencies. Using the amount the user inputtet, print out how much crypto he could get with different currencies. Let's take an example

A user want to put 100$ into crypto. For 100$ he can get

- 0.00162450 bitcoin
- 0.02299988 etherium
- 16.14622615 tezos
- Total that is 16.17085053

The amount a user wants to use on crypto, create that as a variable and give it a good name

*The total does not really make sense in a real world scenario, but it is a good exercise 👍*



Here is an example output using the same amount as above:

```
For 100$ you can get
- 0.00162450 bitcoin
- 0.02299988 etherium
- 16.14622615 tezos
- Total: 16.17085053
```



### Optional

Instead of changing the value of a variable to say how much money a user should put into crypto then ask the user!

You can read about that here in the book or here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/taking-input-in-python/

Now you can even ask the user for his name before converting maybe.
