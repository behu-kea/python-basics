We have now created a new but empty project ðŸŽ‰



### Creating a python file

New **right-click** the project folder (in my case it is the folder called `hello-world`). To even see this view, you might have to click the `Project` tab in the left side that is written horizontally.

Give the file a name and press enter. I will call my python file `hello-world`

Yeah we are a small step closer ðŸŽ‰
