- Boolean operators / operands

## Math methods

**Square root**

```python
sqrt(4)
```

**Exponent**

```python
pow(2, 4) #Returns 2 to the power of 4

#OR

result = 2**4 #Returns 2 to the power of 4
```

**Rounding**

```python
#Rounding upwards 
result = ceil(4.3)

#Rounding down
another_result = floor(4.5)

print(result) #Will print 5
print(another_result) #Will print 4
```



## Exercises 1

##### How many miles? 

- Write a program that prompts the user for a number of miles
- The program prints how many kilometers that equates to
  - One mile is 1.609344 km

## Pair programming

#### Exercise 1

- Write a program that asks the user for two input numbers and prints the maximum number

- Expand the program such that is asks the user for three input numbers and prints the maximum number
- Write a program  that asks for the user's name. If the name is "Bond" make it print "Welcome on board 007." Otherwise make it print "Good morning *NAME*". (Replace Name with user's name)

#### Exercise 2

- Write a program that prompts the user for a number
- If the number is even, the program prints "Even"
- If the number is odd, the program prints "Odd"
- If the number is 0, the program prints "Most would say it's even"
