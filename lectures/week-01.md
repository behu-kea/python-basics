In groups of two find a partner group. Then with the partner group decide what group takes what topic. Now investigate what the methods below does? Create some code showing how to use the method in a program

- List: `max`, `min`, `sum`, `insert`
- Dict `in` and how a dictionary is `iterable`. How can we loop through a dictionary?



1. Spend 10 minutes investigating in your group
2. Spend 10 minutes presenting. Make it easy to understand
